## API Integration

The website uses the [REST Countries API](https://www.apicountries.com/countries) to fetch comprehensive country data. This API provides information about:

- Basic country details (name, capital, region, etc.)
- Population and geographical data
- Languages and currencies
- Flag images
- Border countries
- Regional blocs
- And more

The API is integrated with a fallback mechanism to ensure the website functions even if the API is temporarily unavailable.

## Key Components

### Globe Visualization

The interactive globe is built using Three.js and displays countries as colored dots grouped by continent. Each continent has a unique color, making it easy to visualize geographical regions. The globe rotates smoothly and includes subtle lighting effects.

### Country Explorer

The country explorer page allows users to browse all countries with advanced filtering options:
- Search by name, capital, or region
- Filter by region, population, and languages
- Sort by name, population, or area
- View detailed information about each country

### Blog System

The blog system provides travel guides for each country, including:
- Cultural information
- Travel tips
- Geographic details
- Local customs and languages
- Practical information for travelers

### Theme Support

The website supports both light and dark modes with a seamless transition between them. The theme preference is saved for returning visitors.

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of images and components
- Optimized 3D rendering for the globe
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders
- API response caching
- Fallback data for offline functionality
